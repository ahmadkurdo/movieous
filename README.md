#Preface
Nowadays, people have the internet. Instead of going to the cinemas, they enjoy their subscription on ​multiple​ platforms on which they can stream movies online via mobile, laptop, chromecast, etc.
So we know that there is a very high chance that each individual has a subscription on more than one platform (i.e. Netflix, Prime Video, etc.).
Let’s say an individual wants to watch a movie spontaneously, right. The first steps are to browse through each platform and search for movies. But let’s assume that time is precious for this individual, he/she don’t want to waste time watching a movie with a low rating (i.e. 5.4) on IMDb.
Then, while browsing through each platform, the individual has to also check each movie in IMDb to check if it has a worthy rating. Only then, if the rating is above his/her demands, he/she watches the movie.
But this, whole browsing through platforms and checking the IMDb rating, can be a large time consuming operation. This lead us to our mission!


#Mission
“​We want to provide a platform on which users can browse through all the available movies from ​different platforms​. And on top of that, very important, some extremely useful filter options.​“
